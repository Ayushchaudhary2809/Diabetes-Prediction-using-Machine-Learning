# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This Diabetes prediction project leveraged Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. Algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines were employed. SVM achieved the best accuracy of 78.34%. Deployed Model was able to predict whether patient is diabetic or not. 
The objective of the project "Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning" is to develop robust predictive models capable of accurately identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and analyzing relevant clinical and demographic data, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family history, and glucose levels.
First I collected dataset from kaggle and pre-processed it. (checked for any null or missing values) 
Then, performed a Exploratory Data Analysis.
Then, performed scaling of the dataset to make sure features have similar range.
After scaling used ML Classifier such KNearest Neighbor, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines and choose the classifier with best accuracy for final model deployment.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) has consistently outperformed other algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy, achieving an accuracy of 78.34% whereas KNN has an accuracy of 70.86%, Random Forest has an accuracy of 76.37% and Decision Tree has an accuracy of 70.47%.
SVM Clssifier was deployed to predict whether given input is of a diabetic person or non-diabetic person.
